In this project, I will conduct unsupervised clustering on customer records from a grocery firm's database. Customer segmentation involves grouping customers based on shared characteristics within each cluster. The goal is to divide customers into distinct segments to maximize their value to the business. This approach allows for tailoring products to meet the unique needs and behaviors of each customer group, enabling the business to address the specific concerns of different customer types.
